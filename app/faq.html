<h2>XMRPool.net Pool FAQ</h2>

<h3>How do I get started?</h3>
It's simple!  Head over to the Pool Ports page, and find a port that matches your needs.  We strongly suggest using Global ports, as these will GeoDNS you to the closest server in the network.
If you're using Claymore's miners, all of the Claymore ports are enabled with SSL, allowing you to take advantage of his fee discounts!

<h3>What are all these port/pool types?</h3>
To better serve the Monero community, XMRPool.net has implemented 3 different payout methods for it's miners, as follows:
<ul>
    <li>PPLNS - Pay Per Last N Shares, this is a fair payment system designed to be resistant against pool hopping, as shares expire once there are enough newer shares to replace them.</li>
    <li>PPS - Pay Per Share, this is a great system if you're looking for regular, consistent payments with little-to-no variation, as you're paid for the value of your shares at every block find.</li>
    <li>Solo - Solo mining is great if you like to play risky games, as whoever finds the block, gets the full payout!</li>
</ul>
All of these pools maintain their own block rewards system, so shares used for PPLNS don't get factored into Solo or PPS.
